# About

Over time I had written a bunch of notes and personal docs related to the bitcoin testnet and regtest networks, and realized that putting them together might: _(i)_ be useful to others, and _(ii)_, invite other people to contribute and expand my initially quite small body of knowledge into a more serious resource.

If you have anything to contribute to these docs (ideas, content, special requests), please [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit/learn-bitcoin-testnet), make a pull request, or [contact me directly](https://twitter.com/thunderB__) on twitter!

This website is completely open source and the Github repository for it is [here](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit/learn-bitcoin-testnet).
