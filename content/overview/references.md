# References

This website is merely attempting to be a reference point for putting together and using bitcoin's testnet and regtest networks. It is not an encyclopedia of all of bitcoin-cli commands or all possible uses for those networks, but rather a series of articles outlining how to get started on them. For more exhaustive (albeit sometimes in a less user-friendly format) documentation and help, I recommend these resources:

The [official bitcoin.org docs](https://developer.bitcoin.org/)

The [regtest](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regtest) and [testnet](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/testnet) tags on the bitcoin stack exchange
