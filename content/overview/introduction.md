# Introduction

This site is a _work in progress_. I am hoping to build it into a resource for bitcoin developers and users alike, promoting and facilitating the use of two very important bitcoin networks: the testnet and regtest networks.

## The 3 different types of bitcoin blockchains

Bitcoin core nodes support three networks; _mainnet_, _testnet_, and _regtest_. These are all important in their own way, and understanding how to leverage the testnet and regtest chains is a task worthy of your time and effort, whether it be as a developer on bitcoin or as a user of the currency.

This website is built as a resource to help you better understand the testnet and regtest networks conceptually as well as outline some of the best way to set them up and use them to their full extent.
